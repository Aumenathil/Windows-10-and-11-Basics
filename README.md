# Windows-10-and-11-Basics
I review the Basics and Fundamentals of Windows.
Everyone has to start from somewhere, so here I start with the basics of Windows 10 and 11. 
I'll go through some material I've found useful through CompTIA materials. 

My hope is to build on this repository to more complex tasks and processes to open up this material to a more broad audience.
